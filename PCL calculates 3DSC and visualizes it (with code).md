##  1. Overview of the principle 

PCL :: conventions ShapeContext3DEstimation 3D shape context descriptors are:

If the nearest neighbor of the query point cannot be estimated, the property descriptor is set to NaN (not a number) and the RF is set to 0. For a point without finite 3D coordinates, it is impossible to estimate the 3D shape context descriptor. Therefore, any point that contains NaN data on x, y, or z sets its boundary feature property to NaN.
