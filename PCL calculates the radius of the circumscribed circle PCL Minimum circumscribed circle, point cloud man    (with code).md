#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Calculation formula 

    Where, is the length of the three sides of the triangle and the area of the triangle. Can be obtained by Helen's formula. 

##  2. Main functions

  ```  
 PCL :: getCircumcircleRadius () calculates the circumcircle radius of a triangle composed of three points, and. 

##  3. Source code analysis 

 The functions of the commmon module do not need to be compiled, and can be used directly by including the header file. The source code is located in the PCL's #include < pcl/common/impl/common.hpp > path.
