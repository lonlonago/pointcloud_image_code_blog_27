   Returns an iterator pointing to the smallest element in the range [first, last). The first version uses the < operator for comparison, and the second version uses the comp operator for comparison; if no other element is smaller than one, then the element is the smallest. If more than one element satisfies this condition, the iterator returns a pointer to the first element. 

 The behavior of this function template is equivalent to:
