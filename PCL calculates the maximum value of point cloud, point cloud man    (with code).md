#  Three-dimensional point cloud 

##  1. Detailed explanation of the function 

   There is a point cloud and you want to get its maximum and minimum values on the three axes x, y, and z. You can use the pcl :: get Min Ma x 3D function. The function form is as follows:

#  Two-dimensional point cloud 

##  1. Detailed explanation of the function 

   PCL :: get MinMax 3D function name comes with "3D", obviously not for two-dimensional point cloud, for two-dimensional point cloud calculation can use C++ 11 standard library #include < algorithm > min and max functions. The max () function is a library function of the algorithm header to find the maximum value from the two given values, it accepts two values and returns the maximum value, if the two values are the same, returns the first value.
